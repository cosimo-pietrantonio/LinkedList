# LinkedList

Linked list is a type of list composed by nodes. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list. 

There are different ways to define a linked list based on the reference field:
* Unidirectional references
* Bidirectional references 

In this project, a **right to left** linked list is implemented.
Right to left, as shown in _figure1_, refers to the direction of the links. 
In particular, the first node, called _HEAD_, is a standalone node which point to itself, while the other nodes keep a 
pointer to the previous node.
